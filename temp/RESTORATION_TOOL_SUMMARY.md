- **Single File Restoration**: Restore individual function files with backup creation
- **Bulk Restoration**: Restore all function files at once
- **Selective Restoration**: Restore only selected/modified files
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive validation of restore directory and files

### 2. Modular Architecture
- **RestorationManager** (`admin/restoration_manager.js`): Core restoration logic
- **RestorationReports** (`admin/restoration_reports.js`): Analytics and reporting
- **Enhanced Admin Routes** (`routes/admin.js`): Web interface and API endpoints

### 3. User Interface
- **Bootstrap-based UI**: Modern, responsive design
- **Real-time Status**: Live file status monitoring
- **Progress Indicators**: Loading states and progress bars
- **Interactive Tables**: Sortable file status with checkboxes
- **Alert System**: Success/error notifications
- **Modal Dialogs**: Restoration log viewer

### 4. Analytics & Reporting
- **Health Score**: System-wide file health assessment (0-100)
- **Success Rate**: Restoration operation success tracking
- **Activity Patterns**: Hourly and daily restoration patterns
- **File Categories**: Healthy, needs attention, critical classification
- **Recommendations**: Intelligent system suggestions
- **Export Capabilities**: JSON and CSV export for research

### 5. Logging & Monitoring
- **Restoration Log**: Detailed operation logging
- **Pattern Analysis**: Failure pattern detection
- **Activity Tracking**: Comprehensive restoration history
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error tracking and reporting

## API Endpoints

### Restoration Operations
- `GET /admin/restore` - Main restoration interface
- `POST /admin/restore/file` - Restore single file
- `POST /admin/restore/all` - Restore all files
- `POST /admin/restore/selected` - Restore selected files
- `GET /admin/restore/log` - Get restoration log

### Analytics & Reports
- `GET /admin/reports/restoration` - Restoration analytics dashboard
- `GET /admin/reports/restoration/export` - Export data (JSON/CSV)

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent File Comparison
- Content-based comparison (not just timestamps/sizes)
- Automatic detection of modified files
- Missing file identification
- Backup creation before restoration

### 2. Comprehensive Statistics
- Total files, healthy files, files needing restoration
- Missing files count and critical issues
- Success rate tracking
- Health score calculation

### 3. Pattern Analysis
- Restoration activity by hour/day
- Most frequently restored files
- Failure pattern detection
- Operation type distribution

### 4. Research-Focused Features
- Export capabilities for data analysis
- Comprehensive logging for research
- Pattern analysis for AI effectiveness studies
- Health metrics for system monitoring

## Integration with Existing System
- Seamlessly integrated with existing admin panel
- Uses existing navigation and styling
- Compatible with current logging system
- Maintains consistency with project architecture

## Technical Implementation
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into logical modules
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Async/Await**: Modern JavaScript patterns
- **Bootstrap UI**: Consistent with existing design
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization for analytics
- **File System Operations**: Safe file operations with backups

## Usage Instructions
